	Written by Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam,<b><i>honorable</i></b> President of India. ‘Wings of Fire’ is an autobiography capable of inspiring even a common man into becoming a technologist. A <b><i>well</i></b> composed novel which revolves <b><i>around</i></b> the life of Mr. Kalam a renowned scientist as he shares his experiences and the minutest of details of his life. I like the way the book has been put together along with the delicate facts of his personal life. </p>
